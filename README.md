This is a quick todo list demo app to use for the Generation UK&I Azure Course' practical lab on
building a CI/CD pipeline. It stores the entries purely locally, in the browser's `localStorage`.

Since December 2025, it deploys to Github Pages behind a custom domain, rather than the originally
configured Azure deployment, but is still using a Github Actions CI/CD flow.
